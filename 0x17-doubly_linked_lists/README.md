0x17. C - Doubly linked lists






A doubly linked list is a type of data structure that is made up of a sequence of nodes, each of which contains data and references to the previous and next nodes in the sequence. This allows for efficient insertion and deletion of elements, as well as the ability to move forward and backward through the list.

In a doubly linked list, each node contains two references: one to the previous node in the sequence, and one to the next node. This is in contrast to a singly linked list, where each node contains a reference to the next node only.

The C programming language is a popular and widely-used high-level language that is used for a variety of purposes, including system programming, applications development, and game development. It is known for its speed, efficiency, and flexibility, and is often used in low-level systems programming, where its performance and ability to interface directly with hardware can be leveraged to maximum effect.

An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure for solving a problem or achieving a specific goal. Algorithms are often used in computer science to implement solutions to problems in the most efficient way possible. They are typically expressed in a formal language, such as pseudocode or a programming language, and are designed to be executed by a computer or other computational device.

A data structure is a way of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently. Different data structures are suitable for different types of applications, and are often chosen based on the specific operations that the data will be used for. Common data structures include arrays, linked lists, stacks, and queues.
